      <h1>Solin Fitness</h1>
      <h3>The Home of Social Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        Solin Fitness is literally the GOAT. People be like "1, 2, 3" until
        they're swole AF. And they can do it from home ðŸ˜±.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Solin we use hella technologies. Our stack is built using Typescript,
        React (via NextJs), Node, Express, Prisma and PostgreSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        My responsibilities include carrying the team, making everyone look
        good, and generally being a 100x developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I got there, everything was broken and looked like ass. Then I
        showed up ðŸ˜Ž .
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about development, like how to write a console log, and
        that sometimes you write 'run dev' instead of 'start'
      </p>
      <p>Overall I'd say it's pretty chill. Hire me pls.</p>
